Conclusion:

1.So far we have learned that PCA is a good choice for dimensionality reduction and visualization for datasets with a large number of variables.

2.theory, the PCA makes no difference, but in practice, it improves training speed, simplifies the neural up the required to represent the data, and outcomes in processes that better classify the data's "intermediate structure" rather than having to account for multiple scales - it is more accurate.

3.T-SNE is a non-linear data visualizer, unlike PCA and LDA. It doesn't utilize a straight line to separate the classes or calculate variance, and it doesn't use a norm or distance metric to measure distance between points.

4.By reducing the number of features, PCA aids in overcoming data overfitting concerns. PCA produces a lot of variation, which helps with visualization.
